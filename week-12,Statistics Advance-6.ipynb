    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare means across multiple groups. It comes with a few assumptions to ensure valid results. Here are the key assumptions and examples of violations that can impact the validity of the results:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence of Observations\n",
    "- Assumption: The observations within each group must be independent of each other.\n",
    "- Violation Example: If the data are collected from a set of related samples, such as measurements from the same participants at different times, the independence assumption is violated, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "- Impact of Violation: If observations aren't independent, the test may produce inflated Type I or Type II error rates.\n",
    "2. Normality\n",
    "- Assumption: The residuals (or errors) within each group are approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "- Violation Example: If the data has a strong skew, heavy tails, or is bimodal, the normality assumption is violated.\n",
    "- Impact of Violation: Severe departures from normality can lead to inaccurate p-values and incorrect decisions about statistical significance. For small sample sizes, normality is crucial; however, for large sample sizes, the Central Limit Theorem may mitigate the effects.\n",
    "3. Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity)\n",
    "- Assumption: The variance within each group should be approximately equal.\n",
    "- Violation Example: If one group has much higher or lower variance than others, this assumption is violated (heteroscedasticity).\n",
    "- Impact of Violation: If the variances are unequal, the F-statistic may be distorted, leading to invalid results. This can increase the likelihood of Type I and Type II errors.\n",
    "4. Scale of Measurement\n",
    "- Assumption: The dependent variable should be measured on an interval or ratio scale (i.e., continuous).\n",
    "- Violation Example: If the dependent variable is ordinal (e.g., a Likert scale), ANOVA is not appropriate.\n",
    "- Impact of Violation: Using ANOVA with ordinal or categorical data violates this assumption and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "5. Additivity and Linearity\n",
    "- Assumption: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is linear.\n",
    "- Violation Example: If the data show a non-linear relationship or interactions between variables that are not captured in the model.\n",
    "- Impact of Violation: If the relationship isn't linear or the model fails to account for interactions, ANOVA might not correctly capture the variance, leading to misleading results."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "When These Assumptions Are Violated:\n",
    "- Type I Error: Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive).\n",
    "- Type II Error: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).\n",
    "- Reduced Power: The test may have a lower chance of detecting a real effect.\n",
    "- Misleading Conclusions: Violations can lead to incorrect interpretations, such as finding significant effects when there are none, or missing real effects."
